# CONGRUENCE
"Congruence" is an innovative digital platform designed to address financial disparities and promote inclusive access to financial services. 
It aims to bridge the gap between marginalized communities, providing affordable banking services, Encouraging healthy financial management, facilitating financial literacy, and supporting economic empowerment.
This can be done through a 7 pronged approach. 
## 1. Expense Tracking: 
    This feature allows users to track their expenses and categorise them into different categories.
    Through the help of visual tools like doughnut charts and graphs, the user will be able to increase their financial management
## 2. Risk Assessment:
    This feature uses ML to predict the risk factor that the users face when applying for loans, schemes and other services based on multiple factors     including their financial expenditure behaviours.
## 3. Chatbots:
    This feature uses ML to learn from the users inputs and answer doubts, questions and give financial advice when necessary.
## 4. Forums and Blogs
     In order to promote financial Literacy, this feature selects finaincial blog articles based on the user, to educate them on important finaincial      topics.
## 5. Scheme Filtration
    This feature uses the user's data to filter the optimal government schemes that the users from marginalised communites can access. This tackles       the problem of social awareness when it comes to such schemes.
    
 # Future Scope: Open for all Devs to pitch in
 There are multiple features that on can use to improve the efficiency of the platform. They are:
 ## 1. Improve existing features.
      improvements in UI/UX, structuring of the backend and optimization of code are welcome
 ## 2. "Virtual Financial Worlds"
       This is a novel conept that implements multiple instances of the "expense tracker" code, simultaenously to allow the user to simulate their        financial expenditures, allowing for optimal and comfortable financial planning.
 ## 3. Blog Integration:
      Improvements in the blog Integration software are needed.
 ## 4. Implementation of additional filters in the Scheme-Filtration feature:
      Research shows that GDP and literacy rates influence the impact of nationally available government schemes.
      Implementation of this would produce better results.
